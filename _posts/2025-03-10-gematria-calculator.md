Hey there, fellow explorers! 🌟 I’ve built a **Gematria Calculator** that I’m super excited to share with you. It’s hosted at [jasonbra1n/gematria-calculator](https://github.com/jasonbra1n/gematria-calculator) and embedded below as an iframe. Let’s dive into what Gematria is, how to use this tool, and a mind-blowing discovery I made with "Wayne Gretzky"! 🏒

### What’s Gematria? 🤔
Gematria is an ancient numerology system that assigns numerical values to letters, words, or phrases. Originating from Hebrew and Greek traditions, it’s now a trending topic online, with tons of sites decoding names and phrases for hidden meanings. Think of it as a secret code decoder for words! 🔍 Whether it’s for fun, curiosity, or uncovering patterns, Gematria is everywhere these days.

I wanted my own spin on it—a free, open-source script I could embed on my pages and share with you all to tweak and improve. No gatekeeping here! 🙌

### How to Use the Gematria Calculator 🛠️
Here’s the magic tool in action:

<iframe src="https://jasonbra1n.github.io/gematria-calculator/" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border: none;"></iframe>

1. **Enter Your Word(s)** ✍️  
   Type a word or phrase (e.g., your name, a team, or something quirky) into the text box. Spaces get ignored, so "Wayne Gretzky" becomes "WayneGretzky" behind the scenes.

2. **Select Gematria Systems** ⚙️  
   Click the "Select Gematria Systems" button to open a menu. You’ll see a grid of cyphers—everything from **Ordinal** to **Keypad**. Pick as many as you like!  
   - **Quick Tip**: Use "Select Base" for the classics (Ordinal, Reverse, Reduction, Reverse-Reduction) or "Select All" to go wild. 🌈

3. **Cyphers Galore** 🔤  
   Each system (or cypher) assigns numbers to letters differently:
   - **Ordinal**: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
   - **Reduction**: Reduces to 1-9 per letter
   - **Reverse**: Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26
   - **Sumerian**: Multiplies by 6 (A=6, B=12, ...)
   - **Primes**: Uses prime numbers (A=2, B=3, C=5, ...)
   - And tons more—26 systems total! Experiment to see what fits your vibe.

4. **Display Reduced Values?** ✅  
   Check the "Display Reduced Values" box in the overlay to see each result boiled down to a single digit (e.g., 153 → 1+5+3 = 9). It’s like numerology’s final twist!

5. **Hit Save & Calculate** 🚀  
   Close the overlay with "Save & Calculate," and boom—your results appear in neat boxes below. Each box shows the system name, total value, and (if checked) the reduced value.

### The "Wayne Gretzky" Kicker! 🏒✨
Here’s where it gets wild. I typed "Wayne Gretzky" into my calculator with all cyphers selected and the "Display Reduced Values" option on. Guess what? **Almost every cypher reduced to 9!** 😱 His jersey number with the Edmonton Oilers was famously **99**, and he originally wanted **9** (for Gordie Howe) but settled on 99 with the Greyhounds. Coincidence? I think not! Here’s a taste:

- **Standard**: 441 → 4+4+1 = **9**
- **Sumerian**: 738 → 7+3+8 = 18 → 1+8 = **9**
- **Primes**: 297 → 2+9+7 = 18 → 1+8 = **9**

Try it yourself above—select all systems, type "Wayne Gretzky," and watch the nines pile up! 🖩 It’s like the universe winking at us.

### Why I Made This 🌍
Gematria’s blowing up online, but I wanted a tool I could control, embed anywhere (like this blog!), and share freely. It’s MIT-licensed on GitHub, so fork it, tweak it, make it yours! Whether you’re decoding names, exploring patterns, or just having fun, this script’s for you. Let’s build something cool together! 💻

Drop a comment below with your favorite word to decode, or star the repo at [jasonbra1n/Gematria-Calculator](https://github.com/jasonbra1n/Gematria-Calculator) if you dig it. Happy calculating! 🎉
