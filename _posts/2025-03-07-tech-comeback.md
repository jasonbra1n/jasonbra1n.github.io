ðŸš€ **Full Circle: From Code to Beats and Back Again** ðŸŽµðŸ’»  

Over a decade ago, I was deeply immersed in **technology, coding, and creative problem-solving**â€”before **GitHub was even a thing!** Then, I took a detour into the world of music, DJing, and live entertainment. It was an incredible ride, but now, with greater maturity and vision, Iâ€™m stepping back into tech with fresh energy.  

## **Embracing the Evolution**  
ðŸ”¹ Re-learning and applying **GitHub**, with my first **GitHub Pages website** now live!  
ðŸ”¹ Sharing scripts, tools, and projects Iâ€™ve been building recently.  
ðŸ”¹ Combining **technical expertise with creativity** to solve real-world problems.  

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**  
âœ… Looking for a **weekday role** in IT, development, or creative tech solutions.  
âœ… Elevating my DJing business on weekends with **premium services**.  
âœ… Continuing to merge **tech, music, and innovation** in unique ways.

Excited for this next chapter! If you're in tech, music, or creative problem-solvingâ€”letâ€™s connect!
