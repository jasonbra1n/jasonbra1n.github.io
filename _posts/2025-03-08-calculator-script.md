As part of my journey in learning AI, coding, and embedding scripts into WordPress pages, I created this demo script. I wanted a reliable place to store and showcase it, and I think GitHub Pages is a great solution.  

Below is an embedded version of the script:

You can find the public repository for the code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/jasonbra1n/simple-math-calculator).

By hosting it here on GitHub, I can update and refine it while keeping the integration seamless. This approach makes it easier to share and experiment with interactive elements across different platforms.  

Stay tuned for more experiments as I continue to explore AI and web development!
