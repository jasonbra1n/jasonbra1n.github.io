I’m thrilled to announce that my **Year Progress Calculator** is now officially open source and living on GitHub! As of today, March 10, 2025, I’ve moved the project from my self-hosted setup to its own repository, where anyone can check out the code, use it, or even contribute. You can find it here: [https://github.com/jasonbra1n/year-progress-calculator](https://github.com/jasonbra1n/year-progress-calculator).

### What’s the Year Progress Calculator?

If you’re new to it, this little tool helps you track how far we are into the year. It’s interactive, visual, and super simple to use. Here’s what it does:  
- Pick any date (month and day).  
- See what percentage of the year has passed (e.g., today, March 10, is about 18.9% of a 365-day year).  
- Watch it come to life in a pie chart, with the year as a 360-degree circle.  
- Toggle leap year mode for those rare 366-day years.  

I originally built this as a fun side project and shared it on my WordPress blog. But now, by open-sourcing it, I’m opening the doors for others to play with it too.

### Try It Out

Here’s the live version embedded below—give it a spin!

### Add It to Your Site

Want to use it on your own site? Copy this iframe code:  
{% highlight html %}

{% endhighlight %}

### Why GitHub?

Moving it to GitHub means:  
- **Easy Access:** Embed it anywhere with the iframe code above.  
- **Customization:** The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all in the repo—fork it and make it your own.  
- **Collaboration:** Got a feature idea? Open an issue or send a pull request!  

Right now, it shows we’ve completed 69 days of 2025 (non-leap year), which translates to roughly 68 degrees of our year-circle. Play with the embedded version above to explore more.

### What’s Next?

I’m excited to see where this goes now that it’s out in the open. Maybe someone adds a new visualization, or tweaks it for specific use cases—I’m all ears for suggestions. If you like it, give the repo a star or let me know what you think in the comments below.

Happy tracking
